:) = done


- display selectable list of edges :)
    - when selected, can be edited
    - or deleted :)
- import from dot file? :)
- png preview in scrollable/resizable window :)
- file directory :)

- bug: viewport doesn't update with deleted edges :)
- make opened file's edges listed, selectable and deletable

^^ do these two things and then you can build

- autocomplete when word is entered 

- multiple export options?

- affect node attributes as well

eventual general widget
- color picker
- make "obligations" just a text edit field
    - or something that the user can input their own labels onto?
      like they make a list themself which can then be selected from?
- multiple tabs to edit various things?
