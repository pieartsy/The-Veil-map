:) = done


- display selectable list of edges :)
    - when selected, can be edited
    - or deleted :)
- import from dot file? :)
- png preview in scrollable/resizable window :)
- file directory :)


- bug: deleting one edge (of the same direction) deletes all edges in that direction.
    - keys didn't seem to do anything?

- bug: viewport doesn't update with deleted edges :)
- when you don't select a file to open during the file choosing dialog, the program breaks :)

- make opened file's edges listed, selectable and deletable :)
- should probably add a save file ability?
^^ do these things and then you can build

- autocomplete when word is entered 

- multiple export options?

- affect node attributes as well

eventual general widget
- color picker
- make "obligations" just a text edit field
    - or something that the user can input their own labels onto?
      like they make a list themself which can then be selected from?
- multiple tabs to edit various things?
